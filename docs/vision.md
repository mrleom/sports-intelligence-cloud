# Sports Intelligence Cloud (SIC) Vision

Sports Intelligence Cloud (SIC) is a multi-tenant, cloud-native sports platform that begins with practical tools for coaches and evolves into a broader operating system for sports organizations.

SIC is designed to help coaches, clubs, academies, and sports programs run better workflows, retain institutional knowledge, and build toward more intelligent decision-making over time.

---

## 1. Mission

Help sports communities plan better, operate better, and own their data with secure, accessible, and intelligence-ready software.

SIC begins by solving practical day-to-day coaching problems and grows toward a platform that supports long-term development, organizational continuity, and responsible AI-driven insight.

---

## 2. Product Direction

SIC is being built in stages.

### Stage 1 — Coach-first product
The first product focus is helping coaches create and run sessions under real-world constraints such as:

- player count
- age and level
- time available
- field or space limitations
- equipment available
- training objective

This entry point is the **Session Builder**.

The next intended evolution is a proposed soccer-only **Training Prescription Layer** that helps translate match/performance evidence and coach observations into training objectives, sessions, activities, and diagram-ready outputs. It extends Session Builder and is not shipped runtime behavior yet.

Near-term, this expands into a lightweight **Coach Workspace** direction where:

- first-time coaches set up once
- returning coaches enter a fast session-builder landing flow
- team context carries practical defaults
- KSC-like program and methodology differences stay inside one shared app

### Stage 2 — Team workflows
Once coaches can reliably create and reuse sessions, SIC expands into lightweight team workflows such as:

- team session assignment
- attendance
- session history
- simple planning views

This stage increasingly depends on the team carrying the right product context, such as:

- program type
- age context
- methodology defaults
- planning continuity across repeat usage

### Stage 3 — Club and academy workflows
As usage grows, SIC expands into organization-level workflows such as:

- multi-coach environments
- shared session libraries
- club templates
- organization-owned history
- basic governance and continuity

This includes a narrow coach-admin direction for visibility and methodology governance, without widening the underlying tenant-safe platform model.

### Stage 4 — Sports Organization OS
Long term, SIC can evolve into a broader platform for clubs, academies, NGOs, schools, and sports programs that need one operational system across coaching, planning, reporting, and organizational processes.

### Stage 5 — Intelligence layer
AI and ML remain part of SIC’s long-term direction, but only after real workflows and structured data exist.

This includes things like:

- training insights
- progression summaries
- coach-ready narrative reporting
- future risk and development models

---

## 3. Primary Users

SIC currently prioritizes:

- individual coaches
- assistant coaches
- grassroots and low-budget clubs
- small academies
- clubs with multiple coaches

Over time, SIC can support:

- larger academies
- professional environments
- sports organizations
- schools and NGOs
- structured development programs

At this stage, municipalities and mobility analytics are **not** the active product focus.

---

## 4. Core Problems SIC Solves

### 4.1 Coaches lose time planning sessions
Many coaches still rely on scattered notes, memory, chats, or generic templates.

SIC helps coaches turn constraints into a practical session they can actually run.

### 4.2 Good coaching knowledge is not retained
Sessions, adjustments, and practical lessons often disappear over time.

SIC helps store, reuse, and improve that knowledge.

### 4.3 Clubs lose continuity when staff changes
Training ideas, athlete context, and program consistency are often tied to individuals instead of the organization.

SIC helps clubs move toward durable organizational knowledge.

### 4.4 Teams and clubs lack lightweight systems
Many organizations are too small for expensive, complex software but still need structure.

SIC aims to provide secure and practical tools without requiring a full IT team.

### 4.5 AI and analytics are often added too early or without structure
SIC takes the opposite approach.

The platform first creates structured workflows and then introduces intelligence features on top of real usage and validated data.

---

## 5. Current Product Wedge

The first active wedge is the **SIC Session Builder**.

Its job is simple:

- collect coach environment and constraints
- generate a structured training session
- support quick edits
- save sessions for reuse
- export a session pack
- later connect that work to teams and clubs

This wedge matters because it creates immediate value for coaches while also laying the data foundation for future SIC features.

Session Builder remains the active product wedge.

The next intended evolution is the proposed **Club Vivo Training Prescription Layer**. It keeps grassroots and low-budget clubs as the starting market, with academies and professional environments as a future scaling direction.

That means SIC should improve the product direction around:

- translating match/performance evidence and coach observations into the next training focus
- turning that focus into objectives, sessions, activities, and drills
- producing diagram-ready outputs from structured sequence data rather than raw generated images
- preserving tenant isolation, server-derived tenant context, validation, observability, cost-awareness, and product value before platform expansion

This is still one shared app and one shared tenant-safe product path.

## 6. Platform Principles That Shape the Vision

SIC is built around a few non-negotiable ideas:

- multi-tenant by design
- fail-closed tenant isolation
- tenant context derived only from verified authentication
- serverless-first architecture
- minimal but real observability
- security by default
- cost-aware design
- product value before platform expansion

These are not just technical choices. They shape what SIC is allowed to become and how it grows.

---

## 7. Tenant Model

SIC is organized around tenants running on shared infrastructure.

### Solo coach tenant
A single coach or small independent practitioner can use SIC with low friction and limited setup.

### Club or academy tenant
A sports organization can onboard multiple coaches and teams while keeping data ownership and organizational continuity.

In both cases:

- tenant boundaries are enforced server-side
- tenant identity is never trusted from client input
- tiering affects capabilities, not isolation

---

## 8. Pricing Philosophy

SIC is intended to stay operationally lightweight and cost-aware.

The platform should be accessible to smaller sports environments while still supporting sustainable growth.

That means:

- simple tiers
- predictable usage boundaries
- server-side entitlements
- future premium capabilities for organization workflows
- no weakening of security or data isolation to lower cost

---

## 9. Long-Term Vision

Long term, SIC aims to become a trusted sports platform where coaching workflows, team operations, organizational continuity, and intelligence features are connected in one system.

The goal is not to build every capability at once.

The goal is to grow from a useful coach product into a durable platform for sports organizations, one thin and valuable layer at a time.
