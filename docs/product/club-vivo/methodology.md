# Club Vivo Methodology v1

## Status
Draft v1

## Purpose

This document defines how Club Vivo should support club methodology in the Chapter 2 product direction.

The goal is to allow each club to shape the coaching output without requiring a separate application or separate bot deployment.

SIC should remain one platform capability with tenant-scoped methodology behavior.

---

## Core Principle

Each club should feel like it has its own coaching assistant, but SIC should implement that through:
- tenant-scoped configuration
- tenant-scoped knowledge
- tenant-scoped output behavior

Not through separate bots or separate deployments.

---

## Why Club Methodology Matters

Many clubs want more than a generic session generator.

They want coaches to receive sessions that reflect:
- club language
- age group standards
- training principles
- style of play
- planning format
- curriculum direction

Club methodology support turns Club Vivo from a generic tool into a club product.

---

## Methodology v1 Design

Club methodology v1 should be lightweight and practical.

It should support two layers:

### 1. Tenant configuration
Structured settings stored per tenant.

### 2. Tenant knowledge
Approved club documents or notes that can be referenced during generation.

---

## Tenant Configuration v1

The first configuration layer should support:

- preferred terminology
  - bibs vs pinnies
  - rondo naming
  - field zone labels
- default session structure
  - warm up expectation
  - small-sided game preference
  - finishing block preference
- age band guidance
- intensity preferences
- style of play cues
  - possession-oriented
  - pressing-oriented
  - transition-oriented
- export branding
  - club name
  - logo later
  - footer text later

This should be structured and easy to validate.

---

## Tenant Knowledge v1

The first knowledge layer should support approved inputs such as:
- club methodology notes
- age-group curriculum guidance
- coaching principles
- session format examples
- style of play summaries
- approved drill notes

This layer should be controlled and intentionally limited in v1.

The goal is not to build a heavy knowledge platform yet.
The goal is to give the generator better context when the club has something useful to provide.

---

## v1 Storage Concept

Club methodology should be stored per tenant.

Possible conceptual entities:
- tenant bot config
- methodology document metadata
- approved methodology snippets
- export preferences

All club methodology data must remain tenant-scoped by construction.

---

## v1 Retrieval Concept

When a coach requests a session inside a club tenant, the system should:

1. resolve tenant context
2. load tenant configuration
3. determine whether methodology context is enabled
4. retrieve only tenant-approved guidance
5. inject only the most relevant method context into generation
6. generate and validate the final session pack

The system must never retrieve methodology from another tenant.

---

## Tenant Safety and Priority Rules

Methodology must stay inside the existing Club Vivo and SIC tenant-safe request path.

Non-negotiable rules:

- Tenant identity must come from verified auth plus authoritative entitlements.
- Client input must not choose methodology through `tenant_id`, `tenantId`, `x-tenant-id`, or any other client-supplied tenant identifier.
- Methodology data must be loaded only through server-side tenant context.
- Cross-tenant methodology retrieval is never allowed.
- Missing, incomplete, or unavailable methodology context should fall back to soccer-first defaults rather than making generation fragile.

When multiple inputs influence generation, prioritize them in this order:

1. verified tenant context
2. coach's real-world constraints
3. safety and age appropriateness
4. session contract validity
5. tenant methodology guidance
6. stylistic preferences

Methodology should guide the output, not dominate it. Club preferences must not produce unrealistic, unsafe, invalid, or tenant-ambiguous sessions.

---

## v1 Governance Rules

Club methodology support should follow these rules:

- only authorized users can edit methodology settings
- only approved documents or notes should influence generation
- methodology context should be transparent and reviewable
- tenant context should remain server-derived
- no club methodology should be loaded from client-provided tenant identifiers
- coach-facing users can benefit from methodology context, but only authorized admin or director roles should manage approved methodology settings and guidance
- methodology changes should not weaken tenant isolation or bypass source-of-truth tenant rules

---

## v1 Output Expectations

When club methodology is active, the generated session may reflect:
- club vocabulary
- preferred progression style
- age-specific coaching tone
- methodology-aligned focus
- standardized session structure

The session should still remain practical and constrained by:
- available equipment
- available players
- available time
- available space

Methodology should guide the output, not override reality.

---

## v1 Non-Goals

Club Methodology v1 should not try to become:
- a full curriculum engine
- a full learning management system
- a heavy RAG platform
- a document warehouse
- a director approval workflow engine
- a cross-club content marketplace
- a separate app, bot deployment, auth path, tenancy path, or backend product

Those may come later.

---

## Example

A club configures:
- terminology: use "bibs"
- U10 sessions should be lower complexity
- emphasize possession and scanning
- prefer one small-sided game in every session
- use the club training language for pressing cues

A coach then requests:
- 16 players
- U12 boys
- 75 minutes
- half field
- 10 cones
- 8 balls
- defending focus

Club Vivo should generate a valid soccer session that:
- still fits the coach’s real constraints
- uses the club’s preferred language
- reflects the club’s coaching direction
- remains easy to run and export

---

## Future Expansion

Later versions may add:
- more structured curriculum layers
- age-band program packs
- methodology versioning
- richer retrieval
- stronger approval workflows
- branded club exports

But v1 should stay intentionally small and useful.

---

## Summary

Club Methodology v1 gives each club a tenant-scoped coaching identity inside Club Vivo.

It should remain:
- simple
- controlled
- useful
- tenant-safe
- grounded in real coach workflows
