# Club Vivo User Flows

## Status
Draft v1

## Purpose

This document defines the main user flows for Club Vivo v1.

The goal is to make sure the first release supports the most valuable coach and club workflows without adding unnecessary complexity.

---

## Primary User Types

### Coach
Uses Club Vivo to generate, adjust, save, and export training sessions.

### Club director or technical lead
Defines methodology, terminology, and club preferences for coaches inside the tenant.

### Later supporting users
- assistant coach
- team coordinator
- club admin

## Flow 1 — Generate a Session

### User
Coach

### Goal
Create a session from real training constraints.

### Entry point
- coach dashboard
- new session page
- session builder page

### Flow
1. Coach opens Club Vivo.
2. Coach enters initial input such as:
   - U12 girls
   - 14 players
   - 75 minutes
   - 10 cones
   - 8 balls
   - half field
   - focus on defending
3. System checks for missing essentials.
4. System asks only necessary follow-up questions.
5. Coach submits.
6. System generates a structured SessionPack from the existing Session Builder `POST /session-packs` endpoint family as that contract evolves in place for Club Vivo v1.
7. System validates:
   - minutes
   - equipment fit
   - age and level appropriateness
   - soccer scope
8. System generates diagrams for the main activities.
9. Coach sees the full session.

### Output
- session summary
- activity list
- drill diagrams
- coaching points
- progressions and regressions

For v1, each activity should keep `instructions` as a single string, and any rendered diagram wrapper should use the canonical `drill-diagram-spec.v1` version string plus the shared diagram types: `setup`, `sequence`, `progression`, `regression`, and `condition`.

## Flow 2 — Refine a Session

### Output
A club-aligned session without requiring the coach to manually restate the methodology.

## V1 UX Principles

Club Vivo v1 should follow these user experience rules:

- ask for only the missing essentials
- do not overwhelm the coach with too many setup questions
- keep the output structured
- make diagrams easy to read
- let coaches iterate quickly
- make export simple
- prioritize usefulness over visual complexity

---

## Summary

The first version of Club Vivo should support a small number of strong flows:
- generate
- refine
- save
- export
- reuse
- apply club methodology

If these flows feel smooth, the product will already provide real value to coaches and clubs.
