# Club Vivo Legacy Roadmap and High Level Implementation Phases

## Status

Legacy future-roadmap context from the earlier coach-product naming period.

This document does not override the current Club Vivo Chapter 2 product constitution, source map, or architecture guardrails.

## Purpose

This document preserves an earlier product roadmap for the first club-facing coach product in Sports Intelligence Cloud, and lays out high level implementation phases that could grow SIC from a coach session builder into a broader club and sports organization platform.

This direction stays aligned with the current SIC product wedge, architecture principles, tenant contract, and roadmap direction:

- Session Builder is the current product wedge
- SIC should evolve through thin vertical slices
- Multi-tenant safety is non-negotiable
- Tenant context must come only from verified auth plus authoritative entitlements
- The platform should remain low cost, serverless first, and product led
- AI should be introduced in controlled stages with validation and cost discipline

# 1. Product Positioning

## Club Vivo

**Club Vivo** is the first club-facing product to present to coaches and small clubs.

Its job is simple:

> A coach describes the training reality they have today, and SIC returns a usable training session that is clear, structured, and easy to run.

The first version should help coaches answer practical questions such as:

- How many players do I have today?
- How much time do I have?
- What size field or space do I have?
- What equipment do I actually have?
- What do I want to work on today?

Then SIC should return:

- a structured training session
- activity by activity breakdown
- coaching points
- progressions and regressions
- a printable session pack
- clear drill visuals that help the coach set up fast

---

# 2. Why Club Vivo Should Be First

SIC should begin with a narrow but highly usable wedge.

That wedge is not a general AI chatbot. It is a **coach workflow product**.

Club Vivo should come first because it:

- solves a real pain point immediately
- is useful for low income and grassroots coaches
- fits the current SIC Session Builder direction
- can be built on the existing AWS and tenancy foundation
- creates structured data that supports future SIC intelligence features
- gives clubs an immediate reason to pilot the platform

This product should be good enough for:

- individual coaches
- assistant coaches
- small clubs
- nonprofit academies
- directors who want coaching consistency

---

# 3. Core Product Promise

The product promise for Club Vivo should be:

> Tell SIC what kind of team you coach, what space and equipment you have, and what you want to improve today. SIC will build a training session you can run now.

That means the product should accept:

- sport
- age group or level
- athlete count
- session length
- field or court or pool environment
- available equipment
- session objective or focus

And it should produce:

- session title
- session objective
- total duration
- clear activity sequence
- coaching points
- progressions
- regressions
- safety notes
- assumptions when inputs are missing
- visual drill diagrams
- exportable PDF session pack

---

# 4. Visual Delivery Requirement

A major requirement for Club Vivo is that the output should not be just words.

The coach should receive a session that is visually understandable.

## What this means

Each session should include not only text instructions, but also visual diagrams that show:

- cone placement
- player positions
- ball starting points
- pass directions
- movement directions
- rotation paths
- grid or area shape
- optional mini goals or field markers

The goal is that a coach can open SIC and quickly understand:

- where to place the cones
- how players are organized
- where the ball starts
- where the action moves first
- how to run the drill or game

## Lite visual strategy

For Lite, the correct approach is not to rely on expensive image generation for every activity.

Instead, Lite should:

1. generate a structured session pack
2. generate a structured drill diagram description for each activity
3. render that description into a clear SVG or PNG diagram
4. include that output in the web UI and the exported PDF

This keeps cost lower, increases consistency, and makes the diagrams easier to validate.

## Lite visual quality bar

For the first version, visuals should be:

- clear
- consistent
- readable
- exportable
- easy for coaches to follow

The first version does **not** need to be artistic or perfect.

It only needs to be clear enough that a coach can set up the activity correctly.

---

# 5. Product Architecture Direction

Club Vivo should remain aligned with the existing SIC architecture direction.

## Core architectural shape

- web app for coaches
- Cognito authentication
- API Gateway entry point
- Lambda application services
- DynamoDB for tenant-scoped data
- S3 for session exports and diagrams
- CloudWatch for logs, metrics, and alarms
- optional limited Bedrock usage for generation

## Tenant safety rules

The product must preserve SIC non-negotiables:

- tenant identity is never accepted from request body, query, or headers
- tenant context is derived only from verified auth plus entitlements
- all reads and writes are tenant-scoped by construction
- exports remain tenant-partitioned in storage

## Product design rule

Every club should feel like it has its own bot, but SIC should still operate as one platform capability.

That means tenant-specific behavior should come from:

- tenant-scoped configuration
- tenant-scoped methodology knowledge
- tenant-scoped templates
- tenant-scoped terminology
- tenant-scoped saved sessions and team context

Not from separate bot deployments.

---

# 6. Club Vivo as the First Club Facing Product

## Club demo value

When Club Vivo is shown to a club, the value should be obvious.

A director or coach should be able to see that SIC can:

- save coaches time
- increase session planning consistency
- help newer coaches deliver better sessions
- align sessions with the club's philosophy over time
- produce clean, printable session plans
- eventually support club-specific methodology

## Example club use case

A club like Kensington Soccer Club could eventually configure SIC so that:

- the club has its own methodology pack
- the club uses preferred coaching language
- U10, U12, U14, and summer camp groups have different defaults
- sessions align with the methodology or philosophy the club wants coaches to follow

This is how SIC evolves from a coach tool into a club platform.

---

# 7. Roadmap Overview

The recommended roadmap is:

1. Club Vivo
2. Coach Workspace
3. Team Layer
4. Club Methodology Layer
5. Visual Session Intelligence
6. Club Operations OS
7. SIC Intelligence Features

Each phase should ship as a thin vertical slice that delivers real user value.

# 10. Practical Build Strategy

## Recommendation

Build **Club Vivo now**, but build it in a way that leaves clean seams for the richer future phases.

That means:

- keep one session pack contract
- keep one multi-tenant platform
- keep one authoritative tenant context model
- keep one orchestration flow
- add visual drill support through structured diagram rendering
- leave room for future methodology retrieval and richer intelligence

## Important product rule

The first product should not try to do everything.

It should do one thing very well:

> Give coaches a session they can run today, and make the output clear enough that they can set it up fast.

---

# 11. Next Design Step

The next design step after this roadmap is:

## Define DrillDiagramSpec v1

This should become part of the session pack contract so that each activity can return both:

- human readable coaching content
- machine renderable visual drill structure

That will allow SIC to support:

- web diagram rendering
- PDF session exports with visuals
- future diagram editing
- stronger visual quality over time

---

# 12. Summary

Club Vivo should be the first club facing product.

It should prove that SIC can turn a coach's constraints into a structured, visual, usable training session.

The long term path is not to stay as a simple chatbot.

The long term path is:

- coach tool
- coach workspace
- team layer
- club methodology platform
- club operations system
- intelligence layer built on real usage

That is a strong, realistic, and product aligned direction for SIC.
