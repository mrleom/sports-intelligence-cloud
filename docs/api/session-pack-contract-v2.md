# Session Pack Contract v2

## Status
Draft v2

## Purpose

This document defines the v2 SessionPack contract for SIC Coach Lite.

Version 2 extends the existing structured session output by adding diagram support directly inside each activity.

The purpose of this contract is to ensure that generated sessions are:
- deterministic
- readable
- validatable
- visually useful
- export-ready

Coach Lite v1 is soccer-first, so this contract is written with soccer session planning as the primary use case.

---

## Contract Alignment Decisions

For Coach Lite v1, the contract choices below are canonical across the docs and should be treated as the source of truth before backend work begins:

- `POST /session-packs` remains the existing Session Builder endpoint family and should evolve in place to this contract rather than introducing a parallel Coach Lite pipeline.
- `activities[].instructions` is a single string in v1.
- `activities[].diagrams[].specVersion` uses `drill-diagram-spec.v1`.
- `activities[].diagrams[].diagramType` uses the same allowed set as `DrillDiagramSpec v1`.

---

## Goals

SessionPack v2 should:
- preserve the structured session design already established in SIC
- keep total session duration deterministic
- support text and visual drill output together
- allow exports to PDF and future print layouts
- remain tenant-safe and reusable across saved sessions

---

## Top-Level Contract

A SessionPack v2 object should contain:

- `sessionPackId`
- `specVersion`
- `title`
- `sport`
- `ageGroup`
- `level`
- `durationMinutes`
- `equipment`
- `space`
- `intensity`
- `objective`
- `activities`
- `cooldown`
- `safetyNotes`
- `successCriteria`
- `assumptions`
- `metadata`
- `export`

---

## Required Top-Level Fields

### `sessionPackId`
Unique identifier for the session pack.

### `specVersion`
Required version string.
For this contract:
- `session-pack.v2`

- `club`
- `academy`
- `adult-amateur`

### `durationMinutes`
Required integer.
Must be greater than zero.

### `equipment`
Required array of strings or structured equipment object.
The exact representation may evolve, but the SessionPack must make the required equipment explicit.

### `space`
Required object describing the environment.
Suggested fields:
- `surfaceType`
- `areaType`
- `sizeLabel`
- `width`
- `length`
- `units`

### `intensity`
Optional string.
Suggested values:

### `activities`
Required array of activity objects.
Must contain at least one activity.

---

## Activity Contract

Each activity should contain:

- `activityId`
- `name`
- `phase`
- `minutes`
- `objective`
- `setup`
- `instructions`
- `organization`
- `coachingPoints`
- `progressions`
- `regressions`
- `commonMistakes`
- `equipment`
- `space`
- `constraints`
- `diagrams`

---

## Activity Field Definitions

### `activityId`
Unique activity identifier within the session pack.

### `name`
Human-readable activity name.

---

## New v2 Field: `activities[].diagrams[]`

Each activity may include one or more diagrams.

This is the main v2 extension.

### Purpose
To make the activity visually understandable, not just textually described.

### Diagram array rules
- an activity may contain zero or more diagrams
- a main activity should usually contain at least one diagram in Coach Lite v1
- diagrams must match the activity setup and instructions
- each diagram must conform to `DrillDiagramSpec v1`

---

Allowed values for v1:
- `setup`
- `sequence`
- `progression`
- `regression`
- `condition`

### `title`
Human-readable diagram title.

### `spec`
Full `DrillDiagramSpec v1` payload.

---

## Cooldown

Optional object.
May contain:
- `minutes`
- `instructions`
- `notes`

Cooldown may also be represented as a final activity if the service prefers one uniform activity model.

---

- reduce area if space becomes unsafe

---

## Success Criteria

Optional array of strings describing what success looks like.

Examples:
- defenders close space quickly
- players recognize pressing triggers
- possession group plays with fewer forced passes

---

## Assumptions

Optional array of strings.

This is important when the system fills gaps in coach input.

Examples:
- assumed moderate intensity
- assumed half-field access
- assumed standard warm-up included

---

## Metadata

Optional object.
Suggested fields:
- `generatedAt`
- `generatedBy`
- `generationMode`
- `methodologyApplied`
- `tenantScoped`

---

## Export

Optional object.
Suggested fields:

## Validation Rules

A SessionPack v2 should be considered valid only if:

### Top-Level Validation
- `sessionPackId` exists
- `specVersion` equals `session-pack.v2`
- `sport` is supported
- `durationMinutes` is greater than zero
- `activities` is not empty

### Time Validation
- sum of `activities[].minutes` plus cooldown must equal `durationMinutes`
- any system-added warm-up or cooldown must be included in totals

### Activity Validation
- each activity has a unique `activityId`
- each activity has a positive `minutes` value
- setup and instructions are present
- equipment listed in an activity must not contradict the available session equipment

### Diagram Validation
- all diagrams must include valid `diagramId`, `specVersion`, and `diagramType`
- `spec` must conform to `DrillDiagramSpec v1`
- diagram content must not contradict activity text

---

## Endpoint Evolution Note

SessionPack v2 is the intended in-place evolution of the existing `POST /session-packs` response inside the current Session Builder module family.

Coach Lite v1 should not introduce a separate long-lived backend pipeline or product-silo contract for session generation.

### Training Brief Draft Preview Mode

`POST /session-packs` also supports a narrow preview-only request mode:

- `requestType: "training-brief-draft"`

This mode validates Training Brief draft input and returns a sanitized coach-review draft with clean Session Builder handoff fields. It does not generate a session pack, does not persist Training Briefs, does not expose `/training-briefs`, and keeps coach review required before normal Session Builder generation.

Normal session generation still uses accepted Session Builder fields such as `sport`, `ageBand`, `durationMin`, `theme`, `sessionsCount`, and `equipment`.

### Soccer Validation
- output must be age-appropriate
- output must fit the coach’s equipment and space constraints
- output must remain understandable even if a diagram fails to render later

---

## Error Semantics

If a generated session fails validation, the service should not silently return a broken SessionPack.

Suggested behavior:
- retry generation internally if appropriate
- otherwise return a stable validation error

Suggested reason codes:
- `session_validation_failed`
- `duration_mismatch`
- `equipment_mismatch`
- `diagram_validation_failed`

---

## Relationship to Other Contracts

SessionPack v2 depends on:
- `chat-contract-v1`
- `DrillDiagramSpec v1`
- diagram rendering support for export and frontend display

---

## Summary

SessionPack v2 extends SIC’s structured session output with visual drill support.

The key v2 addition is:
- `activities[].diagrams[]`

This allows Coach Lite to return sessions that are not only readable, but also visually clear and export-ready.
