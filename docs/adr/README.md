# SIC Architecture Decision Records

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records for Sports Intelligence Cloud.

ADRs capture important architecture decisions, the context behind them, and the constraints future work should respect.

## What Belongs Here

- Decisions that affect platform architecture.
- Decisions that set long-lived rules for auth, tenancy, entitlements, data access, API contracts, or infrastructure.
- Decisions that future contributors should understand before changing core boundaries.

## What Should Not Go Here

- Daily progress notes.
- Walkthrough scripts.
- Product brainstorming.
- Runbooks.
- Implementation details that do not represent an architecture decision.

## When To Add An ADR

Add an ADR, or get an explicit architecture decision, for changes such as:

- auth model changes
- tenancy model changes
- entitlement model changes
- public API contract changes
- durable data model changes
- repository or data-access boundary changes
- infrastructure or CDK source-structure changes
- new major AWS service dependencies
- source-of-truth order changes

## Change Rules

- Do not rewrite ADR history casually.
- If an older decision changes, prefer a new ADR that supersedes or amends it.
- Keep ADRs linked from current architecture docs when they define active boundaries.
